	<h1>Which Language?</h1>
	<h2>Python</h2>
	<p>I will teach you how to code in python. Python is not a compiling language which means you don’t need any extra software that checks your code whether there is an error. Also, you can write python line by line, computer executes the code every time you wrote a line. It is called a scripting language. Python’s syntax is very very easy and close to human language, you can understand a few things just by reading the code even though you don’t know the language. However, simple doesn’t mean impotent, Python is a very powerful language that it is used in important areas like data science and machine learning.</p>
	<h2>Java</h2>
	<p>Java is a bit harder than Python, but it is also a good language for beginning. Java’s syntax is strict and more usual than Python’s syntax. For instance, you have to put “;” at the end of every statement. However, this property is very helpful for getting used to general syntax rules of programming. Python has more like a kid syntax but in Java maybe syntax can be a problem for you to learn the logic. Java is used more for its strong Object Oriented Programming (OOP), I won’t talk about OOP but it’s a complex structure for applications. Java is very popular around the world some of the applications of java are: [APPLICATIONS OF JAVA] 
	</p>
	<h2>C / C++</h2>
	<p>C and C++ are the most fundamental programming languages. If I need to compare it, for example if you have a fruit you don’t need to declare that it is a fruit in Python, also you can change it to a vegetable. In Java, you need to declare it as a fruit however, it is not that hard to change it from fruit to vegetable. In C++, these rules are much stricter which means you need to write perfect and errorless code to run the program. However, many of the machines and fundamental applications runs with C++ because it invented earlier and still powerful. [APPLICATIONS OF C++]

	<h2>Other Popular Languages</h2>

		<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
		<li>Javascript (Not JAVA!)</li>
		<li>C#</li>
		<li>Objective C</li>
