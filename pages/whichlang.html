	<h1>Which Language?</h1>

	<h2>Python</h2>
	<p>I will teach you how to code in Python. Python is not a compiling language which means you don’t need any extra software that checks your code whether there is an error. Also, you can write python line by line, computer executes the code every time you wrote a line. It is called a scripting language. Python’s syntax is very very easy and close to human language, you can understand a few things just by reading the code even though you don’t know the language. However, simple doesn’t mean impotent, Python is a very powerful language that it is used in important areas like data science and machine learning.</p>

	<h2>Java</h2>
	<p>Java is a bit harder than Python, but it is also a good language for beginning. Java’s syntax is strict and more usual than Python’s syntax. For instance, you have to put “;” at the end of every statement. However, this property is very helpful for getting used to general syntax rules of programming. Python's syntax is less stricter but in Java syntax can be a problem for you to learn the logic. Java is used more for its strong Object Oriented Programming (OOP), I won’t talk about OOP but it’s a complex structure for applications. Java is very popular around the world some of the applications of java are: desktop GUI applications, mobile applications, embedded systems, web applications, web servers and application servers, enterprise applications, scientific applications.

	<h2>C / C++</h2>
	<p>C and C++ are the most fundamental programming languages. If I need to compare it, for example if you have a fruit you don’t need to declare that it is a fruit in Python, also you can change it to a vegetable. In Java, you need to declare it as a fruit however, it is not that hard to change it from fruit to vegetable. In C++, these rules are much stricter which means you need to write perfect and errorless code to run the program. However, many of the machines and fundamental applications runs with C++ because it invented earlier and still powerful. Some of the applications of C/C++: operating systems, development of new languages, computation platforms, embedded systems, graphics and games, GUI based applications, web browsers, advance computations and graphics, database software, compilers, medical and engineering applications.
