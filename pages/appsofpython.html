	<h1>Applications of Python</h1>
	<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
	<p>
		Machine learning is an amazing technology that is being developed nowadays. To explain machine learning first you need to understand artificial intelligent. First times of artificial intelligent we taught machines what to do in which situations. For example old chess machines calculates the possibilities and selects the best. However in machine learning we taught machines what is good, bad, its aim and how to calculate is it performance is good or bad. To compare, new chess machines play many chess games simultaneously and fast in order to learn how to play the best chess. It takes lessons from previous games and it develops itself in every step. Therefore, they are not hardcoded for every situation and they are much more efficient than old artificial intelligent. Also, in some situations we canâ€™t decide which strategy is best for action, in these kinds of situations we can use machine learning. There is a example of machine learning from google, these models learn how to walk and jump.

		Have you ever felt like somebody reads your thoughts while you are surfing on internet? Like you found very suitable products about a situation which you searched in google, or the recommended videos on YouTube are helpful for your current necessities. These recommendations are all based on your previous choices and search. The technology that analyzes your data is called data science. Also, you can predict stock exchanges with data science. Python is dominating this area with its powerful libraries and simple syntax.
